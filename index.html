            <h2>Numbers and Their Opposites</h2>
            <p>Every number has an opposite, which represents the same distance from zero but in the other direction.</p>

            <p>A special situation arises when adding a number to its opposite. The sum is zero. This is summarized in the following
                property.
                The Additive Inverse Property: For any real number a, a + −a = 0.</p>

            <h2>Absolute Value</h2>
            <p>
                Absolute value represents the distance from zero when graphed on a number line. For example, the number 7 is
                7 units away from zero. The number -7 is also 7 units away from zero. Therefore, the absolute value of 7 and the
                absolute value of -7 are both 7.
                We write the absolute value of -7 like this: |−7|.
                We read the expression |x| like this: “the absolute value of x.”
                • Treat absolute value expressions like parentheses. If there is an operation inside the absolute value symbols
                evaluate that operation first.
                • The absolute value of a number or an expression is always positive or zero. It cannot be negative. With
                absolute value, we are only interested in how far a number is from zero, not the direction.

                Sample explanations for some of the practice exercises below are available by viewing the following video. Note
                that there is not always a match between the number of the practice exercise in the video and the number of the
                practice exercise listed in the following exercise set. However, the practice exercise is the same in both. Integersand
