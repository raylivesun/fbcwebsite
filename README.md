            <h2>Numbers and Their Opposites</h2>
            <p>Every number has an opposite, which represents the same distance from zero but in the other direction.</p>

            <p>A special situation arises when adding a number to its opposite. The sum is zero. This is summarized in the following
                property.
                The Additive Inverse Property: For any real number a, a + −a = 0.</p>

            <h2>Absolute Value</h2>
            <p>
                Absolute value represents the distance from zero when graphed on a number line. For example, the number 7 is
                7 units away from zero. The number -7 is also 7 units away from zero. Therefore, the absolute value of 7 and the
                absolute value of -7 are both 7.
                We write the absolute value of -7 like this: |−7|.
                We read the expression |x| like this: “the absolute value of x.”
                • Treat absolute value expressions like parentheses. If there is an operation inside the absolute value symbols
                evaluate that operation first.
                • The absolute value of a number or an expression is always positive or zero. It cannot be negative. With
                absolute value, we are only interested in how far a number is from zero, not the direction.
                Example 5: Evaluate the following absolute value expressions.</p>
